        <h1 class="ourhead">Started in Dubai, serving customers all over the globe.
        </h1>
        <P class="opara">ASWAT (a telecom consulting company) was founded in Dubai in 2011. After having created the
            Citruss TV call center software from scratch, the founders decided to pivot their business to launch ZIWO,
            the Cloud Call Center Software (CCAAS) designed for the emerging countries.

            Since 2011 we build Voice POPs together with local Telcos, processing the voice locally.

            Today, ZIWO is the leading Cloud Contact Center Solution in the Middle East with customers as Emaar, Tabby,
            Al Tayer, Floward or Deliveroo.

            Our platform is cloud-agnostic and can be hosted in any GCC country. We are compliant with local regulations
            and maintain an unmatched, crystal-clear voice quality with 24/7 support.

            ZIWO is a full API-based solution with ready-made plugins for 15+ CRM systems</P>

            <P class="o-para">"And it's something that will not be replaced any time soon. Human voice remains the
                primary way people make complex and high-value purchases. But we also have WhatsApp and soon other
                channels will be available on the same unique ZIWO interface. The next big thing is Artificial
                Intelligence. We’ve worked on 40 Million call recordings to train our machine learning and we are now
                able to instantly know if a customer is happy or not. Very soon we will help agents with contextualized
                suggestions, or automate actions based on the conversation contents.</P>

                Due to the Telephony element in our service, our value proposition is particularly strong in Emerging
                countries. After the launch of ZIWO back in 2017 in the UAE, we deployed our network in the GCC
                countries. We see a lot of traction in the newly opened market of Egypt.

                That is really exciting because customer experience is so critical for companies. By
                opening in new countries, we offer a high-end cloud alternative for local companies and help our clients
                to expand abroad instantly.”"
